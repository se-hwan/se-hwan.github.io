	<h2>The Remembrall Project</h2>

	<p><b>A Backstory, Explanation, and Introduction: </b></p>
	<p>For those who have no idea what a <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Remembrall">Remembrall</a> is, the best way to understand it would be to read all seven Harry Potter novels. If you don't have that kind of time on your hands, the hyperlink will have to do. 
	</p>
	<p> I realized one day that while I have learned a <i>lot</i> over my time in school, I've retained so little of many of the classes classes that I was loved at the time. All those famous paintings and artists from Art History - gone. The political theories and history from International Relations - a complete blank. It's undeniable that people begin to <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/">specialize</a>, especially going into college and hopefully graduate school, but I still couldn't help but feel a sense of loss from all the things that I knew I once knew that are now completely forgotten. 
	</p>
	<p> And that's what this project is for. Inspired heavily by Evan Chen's <a href="">Napkin Project</a>, I want to revisit these classes I took, enjoyed, and then forgot, and try to regain at least some of what I used to know. From U.S. history to political science, I want a record of what I've learned as if I was trying to teach it to someone else. 
	</p>
	<p> I have no doubt that my Remembrall Project will probably never be fully complete, and will probably be riddled with errors and inaccuracies, but it's a start if nothing else. So here it is.
